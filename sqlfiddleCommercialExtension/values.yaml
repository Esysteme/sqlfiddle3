# This will only work if you have built the docker images locally within
# something like Minikube:
registryPrefix: sqlfiddle

# If you are running outside of Minikube, you will need to publish your
# commercial images to a private registry, as in below:
# registryPrefix: 01234567890.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sqlfiddle

# Use the app server with whatever additional commercial software has been included within it:
sqlfiddleOpenCore:
  appServerImage: appserverextended
  # Indicates whether or not you are running in Minikube (i.e. doing development):
  isLocal: true
  registryPrefix: sqlfiddle

# If you are not in development, you need to manage the appDatabase PostgreSQL
# instance yourself, with an external service. To do so, uncomment this line and
# provide the actual IP/DNS entry for your appDatabase instance:
# appDatabaseIP: 127.0.0.1
